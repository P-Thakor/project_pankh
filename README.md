## Project Overview
PANKH is an innovative Event & Club Management platform designed to modernize how events and clubs are managed at our college. The platform replaces traditional offline paperwork with a streamlined digital system, making event organization and participation more efficient than ever.

## Problem Statement
Traditional event and club management in colleges suffer from inefficiencies such as:
